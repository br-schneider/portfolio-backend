# The Strapi Backend for my [portfolio website](https://brettcschneider.com).

I built this site using Strapi with a couple custom configuration options. It is hosted via a Heroku app that is connected to a postgres database and a cloudinary account for media hosting. You can check the status of the server [here](https://strapi.brettcschneider.com).
